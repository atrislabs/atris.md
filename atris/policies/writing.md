# Writing Policy

Validation criteria for the writing skill. Use during review passes.

## Argument Pass Checklist

- [ ] Does the opening hook grab attention in first 2 sentences?
- [ ] Is there a clear thesis/insight?
- [ ] Does each section advance the thesis?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth between sections?
- [ ] Is there specific evidence (not vague claims)?
- [ ] Does the ending land (not fizzle)?

## Slop Detection

Flag and cut:
- Hedge language ("sort of", "kind of", "in a way")
- Filler phrases ("it's worth noting that", "at the end of the day")
- Generic tech details that don't add ("dual monitors", "MacBook Pro")
- Health blogger speak ("great way to get active calories")
- Corporate speak ("leverage", "synergy", "optimize")
- AI-tell phrases ("I'd be happy to", "Great question!", "Let me")

## Voice Check

- Does it sound like the author, not a generic AI?
- Are there specific details only the author would know?
- Is there lived experience, not just abstract ideas?
- Would you recognize this as their writing blind?

## Structure Check

- Headers: Are they necessary or can it flow as one piece?
- Length: Is every section earning its place?
- Pacing: Does it build momentum or chunk awkwardly?

## Out Loud Test (Human)

Read the entire piece aloud. Mark:
- Where you stumble (awkward phrasing)
- Where you get bored (cut or punch up)
- Where you speed up (the good stuff — keep this energy)

## Sanity Pass

- No typos
- No broken references
- Opening and closing are the strongest parts
- Would you actually share this?

## Before Publishing Checklist

- [ ] Can you summarize the core insight in one sentence?
- [ ] Is there at least one line you're proud of?
- [ ] Did you read it out loud?
- [ ] Would you send this to someone you respect?
- [ ] Is anything "just in case" that could be cut?
