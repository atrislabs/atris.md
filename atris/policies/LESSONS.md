# LESSONS

Purpose: Capture short, actionable lessons after REVIEW misses.

## Rules
- Add only after REVIEW when there was a miss, mismatch, or new constraint.
- One line per lesson.
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD | area | issue -> fix
- Promote repeated lessons (2-3 times) into the relevant policy, then delete.
