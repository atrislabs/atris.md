## Completed âœ…

- **C1:** Fixed `atris activate` command - was calling undefined `startChatLoop()`. Now loads context properly (config, credentials, today's log, MAP.md, TASK_CONTEXTS.md) and displays without auto-starting chat.
- **C2:** Implemented `atris log sync` to push today's Markdown journal to the selected Atris agent, with login/agent checks and clean error handling.
- **C3:** Framework philosophy validated - navigator reads inbox, processes into completed items or next tasks. This is the game loop.
- **C4:** Reset navigator workflow to rerun approval gate properly; cleared analytics tasks for fresh planning cycle.
- **C5:** Archived Inbox ideas I3-I8 (command prompts, product mindset, LLM init, build validation, feature agent) so the team can focus purely on analytics cycle I9.
- **C6:** Patched `atris log sync` to treat equal content as in-sync and align local timestamps after push so we stop false "web newer" warnings.
- **C7:** Added log-sync state tracking + clock-skew handling so local edits push cleanly without overwriting new notes when the server clock runs ahead.

## In Progress ðŸ”„

- **I2:** Self-evolving software framework loops - establishing planning pattern: journal â†’ navigator â†’ tasks â†’ execution â†’ validation.

## Inbox

- **I9:** Kick off Codex testing cycleâ€”log the intent to brainstorm what we can build that's truly useful (maybe analytics) and enjoy the loop.

## Timestamps

**00:32:44** â€” Shipped atris CLI v1: OAuth login with code exchange, agent selection per workspace, daily logs with year folders, interactive pro-chat with SSE streaming. Full AtrisOS backend integration. CLI connects local dev to cloud multi-model intelligence.

**01:14:32** â€” Fixed `atris activate` command and clarified workflow. Now ready for navigator to process inbox.

**01:45:32** â€” Built `atris visualize` command - reads Inbox, outputs 3-4 sentence breakdown + ASCII diagram template for agents. Universal approval gate for navigator/executor/validator.

**02:02:14** â€” Validated: Updated MAP.md with visualize feature entry (bin/atris.js:1289-1353). T13 completed. Full lifecycle executed: navigator identified idea â†’ executor built command â†’ validator updated docs.

**02:08:45** â€” Architectural insight: ATRIS is the middle layer abstraction between user and ANY coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc). We are the instruction manual and the add-on blocks. Commands/skills/instructions are different activation methods for the fundamental coding agent at the bottom. This scales infinitely - one system, infinite agent compatibility.

**02:18:32** â€” Updated validator.md with ultrathink superpowers: explicitly use word "ultrathink" + think 3 times, auto-fix bugs, extract lessons, create validation checks if none exist. Validator is the final gate before human review - strong validator = ship fast without fear.

**02:32:15** â€” T14 complete: Bidirectional journal sync. Validator applied Pareto (skip complex merge), found 20% solution (timestamp check + user prompt). Full lifecycle: navigator created task â†’ executor built timestamp logic â†’ validator confirmed win. Human test required for API integration.

**02:38:20** â€” Cleaned TASK_CONTEXTS.md to 0. New rule: validator deletes completed tasks entirely. File stays at target state: empty. Tasks flow through â†’ get completed â†’ get deleted. Moved future ideas to journal Inbox (I6-I8).

**02:52:33** â€” T15 complete: 3-command agent activation system. `atris plan` activates navigator, `atris do` activates executor, `atris review` activates validator. Commands output agent specs + context for coding agents to follow. Self-evolving loop: activate â†’ log â†’ plan â†’ do â†’ review â†’ repeat. Auto-approved full lifecycle execution.

**03:08:17** â€” T16 complete: `atris status` command. Shows system state at a glance: active tasks count, inbox items (first 3), recent completions (last 3). No need to open multiple files to see current state. Validator fixed regex parsing for clean output. Auto-approved full lifecycle execution.

**03:15:42** â€” Session closing. Proved self-evolving loop works end-to-end. Built the workflow: activate â†’ plan â†’ do â†’ review with instant agent switching. System at target state (0 tasks). Next session pattern: `atris activate` â†’ `atris plan` (approve) â†’ `atris do` â†’ `atris review` (approve) â†’ complete â†’ docs cleaned. This is the future.
- guess we're trying now
- **I4:** Validate atris sync/update mechanism - big markdown file changes shipped, need to ensure update propagation works for all users. This is the magic: continuous spec evolution.
