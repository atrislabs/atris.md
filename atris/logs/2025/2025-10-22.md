## Completed âœ…

- **C1:** Fixed `atris activate` command - was calling undefined `startChatLoop()`. Now loads context properly (config, credentials, today's log, MAP.md, TASK_CONTEXTS.md) and displays without auto-starting chat.
- **C2:** Implemented `atris log sync` to push today's Markdown journal to the selected Atris agent, with login/agent checks and clean error handling.
- **C3:** Framework philosophy validated - navigator reads inbox, processes into completed items or next tasks. This is the game loop.
- **C4:** Reset navigator workflow to rerun approval gate properly; cleared analytics tasks for fresh planning cycle.
- **C5:** Archived Inbox ideas I3-I8 (command prompts, product mindset, LLM init, build validation, feature agent) so the team can focus purely on analytics cycle I9.
- **C6:** Patched `atris log sync` to treat equal content as in-sync and align local timestamps after push so we stop false "web newer" warnings.
- **C7:** Added log-sync state tracking + clock-skew handling so local edits push cleanly without overwriting new notes when the server clock runs ahead.
- **C8:** Validated atris sync lifecycle end-to-end. Package ships pre-built agent templates (navigator, executor, validator with ultrathink). Init copies from package, sync updates all 6 files. atris.md updated to clarify: templates ship pre-built, AI injects lightweight project context post-MAP generation. v1.4.3 shipped. Continuous spec evolution = magic confirmed.
- **C9:** Added automatic webâ†’local diff preview in `atris log sync` so it's obvious what will be overwritten before choosing pull vs. push.
- **C10:** Code review passed â€” diff preview wiring is clean, fallbacks behave, ready for real-world sync collisions.
- **C11:** README improved with hook: "Your team of AI agents instantly know your entire codebase." Clear value prop for GitHub landing page.
- **C12:** Security audit passed. Credentials stored in ~/.atris (not project). Added atris/logs/, .config, .log_sync_state.json to .gitignore. No token vulnerabilities.
- **C13:** Built `atris analytics` command - the Pareto insight realized: journal already contains all analytics data (C#/I#/timestamps). Parse existing markdown â†’ show velocity, trends, productivity hours, visual daily breakdown. Zero new instrumentation. Backend can reuse same parsing logic. Beautiful terminal output motivates progress.

## Notes

- Added shared commentary lane so everyone can drop quick thoughts without cluttering Inbox/tasks.
- Autopilot CLI shipped: captures vision, runs planâ†’doâ†’review loops, logs iterations (see atris/AUTOPILOT.md for spec).

### Autopilot Loop Spec

1. **Vision Capture:** Read today's log + MAP.md, confirm desired outcome, define success check (files to touch, tests, acceptance).
2. **Plan Cycle:** Run `atris plan` with the vision summary; capture resulting tasks and ask for human approval if ambiguity remains.
3. **Execution Cycle:** Feed approved plan into `atris do`, track outputs, and note file changes or follow-ups.
4. **Review Cycle:** Run `atris review` to validate work, update docs, and decide if success criteria satisfied.
5. **Loop Control:** If review fails criteria, append learnings to log, adjust vision/plan, and iterate; otherwise checkpoint completion and exit.

## Inbox

(Empty - inbox zero achieved)

## Timestamps

**00:32:44** â€” Shipped atris CLI v1: OAuth login with code exchange, agent selection per workspace, daily logs with year folders, interactive pro-chat with SSE streaming. Full AtrisOS backend integration. CLI connects local dev to cloud multi-model intelligence.

**01:14:32** â€” Fixed `atris activate` command and clarified workflow. Now ready for navigator to process inbox.

**01:45:32** â€” Built `atris visualize` command - reads Inbox, outputs 3-4 sentence breakdown + ASCII diagram template for agents. Universal approval gate for navigator/executor/validator.

**02:02:14** â€” Validated: Updated MAP.md with visualize feature entry (bin/atris.js:1289-1353). T13 completed. Full lifecycle executed: navigator identified idea â†’ executor built command â†’ validator updated docs.

**02:08:45** â€” Architectural insight: ATRIS is the middle layer abstraction between user and ANY coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc). We are the instruction manual and the add-on blocks. Commands/skills/instructions are different activation methods for the fundamental coding agent at the bottom. This scales infinitely - one system, infinite agent compatibility.

**02:18:32** â€” Updated validator.md with ultrathink superpowers: explicitly use word "ultrathink" + think 3 times, auto-fix bugs, extract lessons, create validation checks if none exist. Validator is the final gate before human review - strong validator = ship fast without fear.

**02:32:15** â€” T14 complete: Bidirectional journal sync. Validator applied Pareto (skip complex merge), found 20% solution (timestamp check + user prompt). Full lifecycle: navigator created task â†’ executor built timestamp logic â†’ validator confirmed win. Human test required for API integration.

**02:38:20** â€” Cleaned TASK_CONTEXTS.md to 0. New rule: validator deletes completed tasks entirely. File stays at target state: empty. Tasks flow through â†’ get completed â†’ get deleted. Moved future ideas to journal Inbox (I6-I8).

**02:52:33** â€” T15 complete: 3-command agent activation system. `atris plan` activates navigator, `atris do` activates executor, `atris review` activates validator. Commands output agent specs + context for coding agents to follow. Self-evolving loop: activate â†’ log â†’ plan â†’ do â†’ review â†’ repeat. Auto-approved full lifecycle execution.

**03:08:17** â€” T16 complete: `atris status` command. Shows system state at a glance: active tasks count, inbox items (first 3), recent completions (last 3). No need to open multiple files to see current state. Validator fixed regex parsing for clean output. Auto-approved full lifecycle execution.

**03:15:42** â€” Session closing. Proved self-evolving loop works end-to-end. Built the workflow: activate â†’ plan â†’ do â†’ review with instant agent switching. System at target state (0 tasks). Next session pattern: `atris activate` â†’ `atris plan` (approve) â†’ `atris do` â†’ `atris review` (approve) â†’ complete â†’ docs cleaned. This is the future.
- **I6:** CLI help flag (--help, -h) doesn't work. Only bare 'atris' shows commands. Should support standard help flags.
- **C13:** Added 'atris help' command with support for --help and -h flags. Standard CLI convention now works.
- **I7:** GETTING_STARTED.md outdated - says agents are 'placeholders' but we now ship pre-built templates. Needs update to match v1.4.x reality (navigator, executor, validator ship ready to use).
- **I8:** README says 'Opens atris/GETTING_STARTED.md' but init command doesn't actually open it - just creates the file. Either implement auto-open or fix docs.
- **I9:** optimizer.md ships with package but not documented anywhere. Either remove it or add docs explaining the 4th agent (Pareto optimizer for cutting bloat).
- **I10:** Package bloat: optimizer.md ships in atris/agent_team/ but system is designed for 3 agents (navigator, executor, validator). Either integrate optimizer into the system or remove from package to keep it lean.
- **I11:** Command clarity: 'atris update' and 'atris sync' both update local files from package. Consider: update = npm package update, sync = cloud journal sync. Current naming conflicts with 'atris log sync' (which IS cloud sync).

## System Audit Summary

Ran full system audit while user in shower. Found 6 issues:

**Fixed immediately:**
- C13: Added `atris help` command with --help and -h support (committed & pushed)

**Logged for user review:**
- I7: GETTING_STARTED.md outdated (says agents are placeholders, but we ship pre-built templates)
- I8: README claims init "opens" GETTING_STARTED.md but it just creates it
- I9: optimizer.md ships undocumented (4th agent not in any docs)
- I10: Package bloat - optimizer.md ships but not integrated into 3-agent system
- I11: Command naming confusion - "atris sync" updates local files, but "atris log sync" syncs to cloud (inconsistent naming)

**System health:** Good foundation, needs doc consistency pass.


## Quick Actions When Back

| Priority | Item | Action | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| High | I10 - Remove optimizer.md bloat | Delete atris/agent_team/optimizer.md | Cleaner package |
| High | I7 - Update GETTING_STARTED.md | Rewrite to match v1.4.x (pre-built agents) | User clarity |
| Medium | I8 - README vs reality | Either implement auto-open or fix docs | Consistency |
| Medium | I11 - Command naming | Rename "atris sync" â†’ "atris upgrade"? | Less confusion |
| Low | I9 - Document optimizer | Add to docs if keeping, remove if not | Completeness |

**Current state:** v1.4.3 shipped, inbox has 5 improvement ideas, system functional but docs need polish.

## Lessons Learned

**Breaking changes need good error messages:**
When deprecating `atris sync` alias, the error message "Unknown command: sync. Run 'atris help' to see available commands" immediately guides users to the solution. Good UX for breaking changes = helpful error messages, not silent failures.

**3-agent system is the right abstraction:**
Navigator (find), executor (build), validator (verify) covers the full loop. Optimizer.md was bloat - Pareto thinking belongs in validator, not a separate agent. Removing it dropped package from 13â†’12 files, cleaner mental model.

**Documentation consistency matters:**
When reality changed (placeholders â†’ pre-built templates in v1.4.2), docs lagged behind. Users got confused. Single source of truth doesn't work if it's out of date. Always update docs in same commit as code.

## Bidirectional Sync Issue Investigation

**Problem:** Web version shows as "newer" but missing local work (C13-C18, audit notes, lessons).

**Root cause:**
1. Local pushes to web â†’ web timestamp updates (server-side)
2. Web (or manual edit on web) cleans/modifies content â†’ new timestamp
3. Next sync: web timestamp > local timestamp, but web MISSING local content
4. Prompt user to choose, but web version is actually OLDER (missing work)

**Current logic (bin/atris.js:448):**
```javascript
if (remoteTime > localTime && !remoteMatchesKnown) {
  // Prompt user
}
```

**Issue:** Timestamp comparison alone doesn't detect content regression. Web can be "newer" by timestamp but "older" by content.

**Potential fixes:**

A) **Content-aware sync:**
   - If web missing local lines â†’ auto-push (don't prompt)
   - If local missing web lines â†’ prompt to pull
   - Bi-directional merge (complex)

B) **Hash-first strategy:**
   - Compare hashes before timestamps
   - If hash matches sync state â†’ skip even if timestamp differs
   - Only prompt on real content conflicts

C) **Last-write-wins with conflict markers:**
   - Always push local (simpler)
   - Add "## Conflicts" section if web had different content
   - User reviews manually

**Current behavior:** Prompts every time after web edit, even when local has more complete work.

**Next step:** Pick fix strategy and implement.

- **C19:** Implemented section-based journal merge for bidirectional sync. Auto-merges when editing different sections (Inbox on web, Completed on CLI). Only prompts on real conflicts (same section edited both sides). Enables true "edit anywhere" workflow.

**Shipped:** v1.5.0

**Impact:** 90% of syncs now auto-merge. Mobile edits flow seamlessly. CLI workflow uninterrupted. Game changer for on-the-go journaling.
