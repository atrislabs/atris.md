## Completed

- **C1: Created atris-design.md policy** — frontend aesthetics guide (typography, color, layout, motion, backgrounds)
- **C2: Created atris-backend.md policy** — backend architecture guide (naming, abstractions, errors, data access, api design)
- **C3: Added Claude skills for both policies** — .claude/skills/atris-design and atris-backend, reference ATRIS workflow
- **C4: SEO optimization** — package.json keywords, README first paragraph, targets "atris dev" search
- **C5: Trojan horse adoption strategy** — skills expose other agents to ATRIS commands and workflow

## Notes

Session started from Anthropic blog post on "Improving frontend design through Skills". Key insight: policies as source of truth, skills as compact Claude-compatible exports.

Policies live in `atris/policies/`, skills auto-generated to `.claude/skills/`.

Next: wire `atris review` to check relevant policies based on task type.
