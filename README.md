# ATRIS

Drop `atris.md` into any codebase and have your favorite coding agent (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, etc.) read it to scaffold a fully-instrumented, AI-navigable system in under 10 minutes. The agent will generate CODE_MAP.md, three specialized agent specs, and TASK_CONTEXTS.mdâ€”transforming your project into a self-documenting workspace with exact file:line references for every feature.
