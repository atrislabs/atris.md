# Atris

Drop one command. Your team of AI agents instantly know your entire codebase.

No more "where is the auth logic?" or "which file handles payments?" Atris gives AI agents a navigation system with exact file:line answers in seconds.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g atris
```

## Usage

```bash
cd your-project
atris init
```

Opens `atris/GETTING_STARTED.md` with full instructions. Your AI agent reads `atris/atris.md` and generates:
- **MAP.md** - Navigation guide with file:line precision
- **agent_team/** - Navigator, executor, validator specs
- **TASK_CONTEXTS.md** - Structured task bank

Takes ~10 minutes. Works for code, product, sales, researchâ€”any system.

## Update

```bash
atris update
```

Syncs local `atris.md` to latest version.
