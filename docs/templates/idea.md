# Feature Name

## The Idea (Human Layer)

Write your messy thoughts here. No structure needed. Think out loud.

What are you trying to build? Why does it matter? What problems does it solve?

Feel free to:
- Change your mind mid-thought
- Ask questions
- Throw around alternatives
- Be uncertain

This is the raw intent. The parser will organize it.

## Parser Confirmation (ASCII)

The agent will show you an ASCII visualization here to confirm understanding.
You'll review and approve before the build plan is generated.

Example:
```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ FEATURE NAME                  │
├───────────────────────────────┤
│ Key points:                   │
│ • Point 1                     │
│ • Point 2                     │
│ • Point 3                     │
└───────────────────────────────┘

Summary in 3-4 sentences.
Correct? (y/n)
```

Once you confirm, the agent generates build.md and begins execution.
